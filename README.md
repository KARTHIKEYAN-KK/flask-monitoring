Introduction
Monitoring is an essential aspect of maintaining and scaling web applications. This project demonstrates how to set up basic monitoring for a Flask application using Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit.

Features
Basic Flask application setup
Integration with Prometheus for monitoring
Pre-configured metrics endpoint for Prometheus scraping
Instructions for setting up Prometheus and Grafana for visualization
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Python 3.6 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Docker (optional, for running Prometheus and Grafana in containers)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-monitoring.git
cd flask-monitoring
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Start the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
flask run
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

The Prometheus metrics endpoint will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/metrics.

Prometheus Configuration
Download and install Prometheus from the official website.

Create a configuration file prometheus.yml with the following content:

yaml
Copy code
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'flask'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['host.docker.internal:5000']
Start Prometheus with the configuration file:

bash
Copy code
prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
Grafana Integration
Download and install Grafana from the official website.

Start Grafana:

bash
Copy code
grafana-server
Open Grafana in your browser at http://localhost:3000/.

Add Prometheus as a data source:

Go to Configuration > Data Sources > Add data source
Select Prometheus
Set the URL to http://localhost:9090
Click Save & Test
Import a dashboard to visualize Flask metrics:

Go to Create > Import
Enter the dashboard ID from the Grafana dashboards library (e.g., 1860 for a general Node Exporter Full dashboard)
Click Load
Select Prometheus as the data source and click Import
